Happiness Plans â€” Project bundle

Contents:
- html_version/: Static HTML/CSS/JS sample site (open html_version/index.html to view).
- react_version/: React app scaffold (uses Vite). Run `npm install` then `npm run start`.
- assets/: small SVG icons included in html_version.

Notes:
- Contact forms are demo-only and do not send emails.
- The React app is a minimal scaffold for local development; you can expand components as needed.
